Study Goals & Design

Goals: 
- Evaluate basic usability of system
- Compare way of PWRM usage with self-reported personal strategies
-- report in pre-questionnaire
-- onboarding choice
-- actual usage (naming of categories)
- does password categorization help to remember (reused) password-account linking?




Ideas:
- test willingness of password storage in different models provided
-- Unique password option only
-- Categorization & active reuse-support
-- both

--> might be biased by different personal habits and not be objective enough (?)
